## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to promote transparency and trust in NGO funding by allowing donors to track their contributions on the blockchain. This ensures accountability and enhances confidence in the usage of donated funds.

## Key Features
- **Donate Ether:** Public donors can send Ether directly to the NGO's smart contract.
- **Transparency:** Donors can track their individual donations and see the total balance in the contract.
- **NGO Withdrawals:** The NGO can withdraw funds when needed, and every withdrawal is recorded on the blockchain.
- **Event Emissions:** The contract emits events for donations and withdrawals, providing an auditable log of transactions.


## Future Enhancements
- Integrate reporting mechanisms for how withdrawn funds are being used by the NGO.
- Add support for ERC-20 token donations.
- Implement a voting mechanism for donors to approve withdrawals, increasing community involvement.
